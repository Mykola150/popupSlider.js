# popupSlider.js
Simple RAW JavaScript popup slider. Some features are commented in the code:

- load the slider to the container with id #popupSlider;
- closing the popup clicking outside;
- make the carousel (auto slide changing with interval 5 seconds) - stop when the slide was changed manually.


# Planned in the future
- make the external config file;
- change the makeup for the situations when the slider would be embedded.
